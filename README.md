## About the project

This app allows displaying and adding interesting places on the map, which are worth visiting and where to fly a drone.

After entering a location in the search engine, previously added places with their brief description are returned from
the database (MySQL). The results in a given town can be further narrowed down by typing the street.

The application is connected to the [IMGW weather API](https://danepubliczne.imgw.pl/apiinfo). If a town has a weather
station operated by IMGW, the latest available weather data is displayed for it, if not - the information will not
appear.

The weather data is validated and the corresponding information appears about whether the current weather conditions are
good or bad for flying a drone.

## Upcoming plans for the expansion of the project:

* Implementation for adding (support with middleware 'multer' on backend prepared) and displaying photos of places,
* Implementation for user registration and login (Passport JS),
* Enabling addition / modification / deletion of added places only for logged-in users (and only for 'own' places),
* Finding a free API with more meteo points (stations) and implementing it,
* Mobile version of app,
* Refactoring the code.

## The project used:

* Node.js,
* Express framework,
* MySQL database,
* TypeScript (backend + frontend),
